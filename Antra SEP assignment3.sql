--11. How do you remove the duplicates record of a table?
/*
	We can first find the duplicate values by using GROUP BY with every column within the table, and 
	using HAVING COUNT(column) > 1. By doing this, we can get duplicate rows.

	We then can delete the records then input a single record per originally duplicate rows.
